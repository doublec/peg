Parsing Expression Grammar
==========================

This is an import of Ian Piumarta's peg/leg system for using parsing
expression grammars from C. The original code was from:

  http://piumarta.com/software/peg/peg-0.1.4.tar.gz

I applied changes to enable the generated grammars to compile with
g++.

Documentation is at:
